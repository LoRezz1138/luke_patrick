I'm a Technology Solutions Specialist with a robust background in construction cost estimating, project management, business intelligence, and process optimization. I excel at delivering precise results and driving impactful operational improvements for large-scale projects. My expertise spans cost estimation, resource allocation, and leveraging technology to enhance efficiency.

Currently, I work at Green Team Pest, a rapidly growing pest control company in Texas and Florida. In this role, I wear many hats: systems administration, mobile device management, data analysis, and business intelligence, to name a few. It's a dynamic environment where I get to apply my diverse skill set to solve various challenges.

My Journey So Far üöÄ

- Chicago Bridge & Iron: I prepared estimates for projects ranging from $300M to $20B, contributing to major contract awards like the $550M Longford Gas Plant. As a General Project Estimator, I introduced innovative estimation techniques and enhanced proposal quality, driving cost efficiency and increasing project win rates.
  
- Bryan & Bryan Inspections: I led transformative initiatives, scaling the inspection team from 11 to over 30, developing SOPs and training programs, and implementing software solutions that reduced report completion time by 20%. I also spearheaded new business and service development, successfully increasing market share and revenue.

- Skanska Building USA: As a Preconstruction Intern, I honed my skills in conducting detailed quantity takeoffs and refining bid proposals, improving accuracy and success rates. This early experience provided a solid foundation for my career-long commitment to precision and strategic innovation.

My Approach üåü

My approach is rooted in balancing technical expertise with strategic foresight. By fostering strong stakeholder relationships, implementing tech-driven solutions, and optimizing processes, I consistently enhance service delivery and operational efficiency. I am passionate about delivering results that align with organizational goals, demonstrating excellence and innovation in every project I undertake.
