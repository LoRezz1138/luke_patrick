With a robust background in construction cost estimating, project management, and process optimization, and business intelligence, I excel at delivering precise results and driving impactful operational improvements for large-scale projects. My expertise spans cost estimation, resource allocation, and leveraging technology to enhance efficiency.

At Chicago Bridge & Iron, I prepared estimates for projects ranging from $300M to $20B, contributing to major contract awards like the $550M Longford Gas Plant. My role as General Project Estimator involved introducing innovative estimation techniques and enhancing proposal quality, which drove cost efficiency and increased project win rates.

During my tenure at Bryan & Bryan Inspections, I led transformative initiatives, scaling the inspection team from 11 to over 30, developing SOPs and training programs, and implementing software solutions that reduced report completion time by 20%. Additionally, I spearheaded new business and service development, successfully increasing market share and revenue.

As a Preconstruction Intern at Skanska Building USA, I honed my skills in conducting detailed quantity takeoffs and refining bid proposals, improving accuracy and success rates. This early experience provided a solid foundation for my career-long commitment to precision and strategic innovation.

My approach is rooted in balancing technical expertise with strategic foresight. By fostering strong stakeholder relationships, implementing tech-driven solutions, and optimizing processes, I consistently enhance service delivery and operational efficiency. I am passionate about delivering results that align with organizational goals, demonstrating excellence and innovation in every project I undertake.
